/**
 * Enum type for the method used to detect the soft chromatic genus pattern between scale's intervals to allow mapping
 * them on a keyboard by using the characteristic augmented second, despite `shouldMapQuarterTonesLow` property.
 *
 * A pattern of intervals that have the soft chromatic genus is defined here as a trichord with two neighboring
 * relative intervals out of which one is a three-quarter-tone interval and the other is a remaining between a whole
 * tone and an augmented second. The [[aug2Threshold]] property determines the minimum value in cents of the
 * "augmented second".
 *
 * These two intervals can be seen in a tetrachord by adding an interval which has a size between a semitone and a
 * three-quarter-tone.
 *
 * For example, an Easter Hijaz / Hicaz soft tetrachord may have the absolute intervals 12/11, 5/4 and 4/3. The first
 * relative interval is a three-quarter-tone of about 151 cents and the augmented second has about 236 cents. When
 * `shouldMapQuarterTonesLow` is set to false this tetrachord would be mapped on the C key to C, D, E and F keys.
 * However, one would expect a chromatic tetrachord to be mapped to C, Db, E and F. This feature allows that.
 *
 * @param name          The identified of the mapping method.
 * @param aug2Threshold The minimum size in cents of the augmented second.
