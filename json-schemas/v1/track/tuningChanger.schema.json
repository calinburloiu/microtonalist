    "description": "A tuning changer is a plugin that triggers a tuning change based on the input MIDI messages. Currently, there are three kinds of tuning change operations that can be triggered by this plugin:\n- \"previous\": Changes to the next tuning from the sequence. If the current tuning is the first one, it wraps around to the last tuning.\n- \"next\": Changes to the next tuning from the sequence. If the current tuning is the last one, it wraps around to the first tuning.\n- \"index\": Changes to the tuning with the specified index in the sequence, starting the count from 0. If the index exceeds the last tuning, a change to the last tuning is triggered.\nAs any plugin it can be defined as an object with a \"type\" property that identifies the tuning changer to be used. Check the documentation for that property for details about what tuning changer are supported.",
